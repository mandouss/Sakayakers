_**Introduction**_:

Studying and working at Duke, we are engaging with Sakai any time at any place. Many of Sakai accesses are made with mobile device. Now we can visit the website directly
through browser, which is relatively slow. An alternative is an accessory version of Sakai as part of DukeMobile application. Both have same problem: bad UI design disable us from
using it effectively. After contacting official Sakai develop staff, we are guaranteed to have REST APIs offered by OIT that support all the features. Leveraging some of these APIs, the
Duke Sakai App will be able to work for an authenticated user a subset of Sakai functions and display them in a better Android user interface.



_**Task distribution**_:

Yuhan Liu: Sites view and sites subview

Wuyi Sun: Assignments view and Gradebook view.
